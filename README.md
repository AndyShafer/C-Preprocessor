# C-Preprocessor
This project is an implementation of the C preprocessor using Haskell. The motivation for this project was to improve my skills in Haskell and to learn monadic parsing. The library used for parsing is Parsec. This project currently implements some of the most commonly used features for macros, includes, and conditional directives. My goal is to implement the rest of the features so that this program can accurately preprocess code from sources like the standard library that heavily use preprocessor directives.
